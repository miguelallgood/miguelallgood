- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel. I have a knack for developing, testing, and implementing machine learning models.
- 👀 I’m interested in working in an international environment with a highly technical product range. I value an open work environment with a flat organization, helpful colleagues, and accessible managers where there's autonomy and room for initiative.
- 🌱 I have recently completed a 7-month intensive Data Science bootcamp at BeCode. During this program, I gained proficiency in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and critical problem-solving. I am eager to apply these skills to real-world projects and contribute to innovative solutions.
- 💞️ I advocate for treating data as a strategic asset as organizations transition to data-centric models. I believe that making informed decisions isn't just about bytes, but about understanding and interpreting the data.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at bueno.reyes.miguel@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside of work, I’m a fitness enthusiast with a particular fondness for racket sports, especially Padel and Squash.
